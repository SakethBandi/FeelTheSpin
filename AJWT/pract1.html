<p><i>Bitcoin is continuously increasing in popularity across the world. The crucial difference between actual cash and bitcoin is that it can be utilised without the need for internet access. It is very tough to identify the address of the users until they connect a bitcoin address to their name. The users are not tracked by bitcoin usually, although the addresses where the money is stored are continuously tracked. There are two vital parts of every address, for instance, private and public.<br>

The bitcoin address is built from the public key. It is very similar as compared to an email address, anyone can check-up and provide bitcoins. The private key is known to be identical to that of an email password since it is possible to send bitcoins with the help of remote access only. Thatâ€™s why it is essential to keep the private key confidential or hidden.<br>
